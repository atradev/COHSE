NA Hypocapnia	
TM Hypocapnia	@lang=en;match=ci,no
TM |DEFINITION|An insufficient amount of CO2 in the blood (defined as pCO2 levels less than 35 mmHg), often the result of hyperventilation.Hypocapnia can cause weakness, faintness, headache, blurred vision and if untreated possibly unconsciousness. The body's breathing stimulus results from the monitoring of the CO2 and oxygen (the oxygen drive is only active at extremely low oxygen levels, CO2 is the MAJOR controlling factor) levels in the blood stream. An increase in CO2 and a decrease in oxygen trigger the body to breathe. As the CO2 levels drop, so does the body's natural stimulus to breathe. This is one of the primary causes of shallow water blackout.

NA On Gassing	
TM On Gassing	@lang=en;match=ci,no
TM |DEFINITION|As a person breathes air or any mixture of gases, a portion of those gases are absorbed through the lungs into the blood stream. Ongassing occurs primarily in the alveoli of the lungs (though it does occur at all levels, lungs, blood, tissues). This absorbed (or dissolved) gas is carried dissolved in the bloodstream and diffuses from areas of high partial pressure to areas of lower partial pressure throughout the various tissues (or compartments). As oxygen is metabolised it is generally not considered to be ongassing but does have limits as to how much can be absorbed safely. Excessively high partial pressures of oxygen can be absorbed and contribute to DCS, so ongassing as a term can be applied to oxygen. However, the partial pressures that can cause this are higher than those considered safe in relation to CNS O2 toxicity, so this is more an academic concern, rather than a real concern.

NA Hypothermia	
TM Hypothermia	@lang=en;match=ci,no
TM |DEFINITION|A condition in which the deep tissue or core temperature of the body falls below the normal physiological range, approximately 36.9C. Heat loss is the result of exposure to cold, and most divers are exposed to water temperatures below that of their body. The rate of the heat loss is dependent on body area, the difference in the temperature between the body and the surrounding environment, body fat, external insulation and the level of physical exertion. As the core temperature begins to drop signs of hypothermia will begin to appear. This will trigger the body to begin producing extra heat, usually in the form of shivering. If the cooling is allowed to continue the core temperature will begin to drop and all bodily processes will slowly grind to a halt as pulse and respiration's slow. Death will follow if the diver is not treated promptly.
