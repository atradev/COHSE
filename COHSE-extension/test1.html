In July, 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DOE) asked the National Research Council�s Board on <a href="google.com">Life Sciences</a> to convene a committee to examine the current state of biological research in the United States and recommend how best to capitalize on recent technological and scientific advances that have allowed biologists to integrate biological research findings, collect and interpret vastly increased amounts of data, and predict the behavior of complex biological systems. From September 2008 through July of 2009, a committee of 16 experts from the fields of biology, engineering and computational science undertook to delineate those scientific and technological advances and come to a consensus on how the U.S. might best capitalize on them. This report, authored by the Committee on a New Biology for the 21st Century, describes the committees work and conclusions.
The committee concluded that biological research has indeed experienced extraordinary scientific and technological advances in recent years. In the chapter entitled Why Now? the committee describes the integration taking place within the field of biology, the increasingly fruitful collaboration of biologists with scientists and engineers from other disciplines, the technological advances that have allowed biologists to collect and make sense of ever more detailed observations at ever smaller time intervals, and the enormous and largely unanticipated payoffs of the Human Genome Project. Despite this potential, the challenge of advancing from identifying parts, to defining complex systems, to systems design, manipulation, and prediction is still well beyond current capabilities, and the barriers to advancement are similar at all levels from cells to ecosystems.
Having delineated the advances, the committee set about reaching an agreement as to how the U.S. could best capitalize on them. The committee was invited to use the following series of questions to guide its

One good thing about scuba gear is that because it’s waterproof, you can wash it. In fact, all scuba gear should be rinsed in clean, fresh water after every dive. Then, it should be dried before storing it in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Bar
